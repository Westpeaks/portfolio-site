    <p className="mb-3">
        A long way off from a computer science degree, I originally graduated with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">English</span>. This degree has given me a great foundation in the ability to comunicate. 
        After 3 years of teaching, I decided to pursue a new career in programming. I am a proud graduate of the{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Launchcode</span> program through <span className="font-medium">UMKC</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is to see design come to life. 
        I deeply <span className="underline">enjoy</span> seeing a project unfold like a painting. Due to my communication skills 
        and my love of helping others, I have excelled in being a{" "} 
        <span className="font-medium">Technical Support Engineer</span>. This had led me on a great journey, working for some 
        great companies and has provided me with a robust tool set for taking on technical challenges. I am currently looking for 
        a{" "} <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a{" "}<span className="font-medium">Senior Support Engineer</span>.

      <p>
        <span className="italic">In my downtime</span>, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, making music, and reading. 
        I'll also bust out some DJ skills if the right person asks. When I am not engaged in those activities, I enjoy{" "} 
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently studying to become a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Cloud Engineer</span>.
